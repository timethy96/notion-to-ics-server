# notion-to-ics-server

This is a self-hosted on-demand ics serving converter api for notion calendars. It was written quickly and dirty for the only purpose of my own use. I have no time to give support or to update the code. Feel free to take the code and make something of your own.

It is based on [mianfg/notion-to-ics](https://github.com/mianfg/notion-to-ics)
and [tiangolo/fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
